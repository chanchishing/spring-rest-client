# spring-rest-client
This is the Recipe Project of the course that I code along when taking the Udmey course "Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru" on creating Rest Client

The course video was created in 2017-18, some of the software version used in the course video is a bit old (eg JDK 8 JUnit4, Bootstrap3), in this code-along exercise I try to use the latest software version available to-date (Jan 2022) as far as possible.

* Springboot 2.6
* OpenJDK 11
* JUnit 5

The User object used in the course video is based on http://apifacketory/api/user, which is no longer available for use.
User object in this exercise is based on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users instead.
